# Heart-rate-variability-project

This repository stores the individual code exercises (folders 1 to 6) prior to the final group work ("projekti" folder). 
In them there is code that was used to build heart rate variability monitor using a Raspberry Pico W connected to the internet and a PPG sensor.

The individual works are done exclusively by me and the final project is a union of those works by a team of 4 people. 
This is a hardware project made in the Information Communications Technology school of Metropolia University of Applied Sciences, Helsinki.
